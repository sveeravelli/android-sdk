The original build scripts (e.g. android-sdk, sdk-helper.sh) have been replaced.
Please use the following:

    android_build             : generate the release
      options:
        -h                : show full help text
        -nt               : do not run the unit tests
        -v=<VERSION>      : update the version to <VERSION> where <VERSION> is in the form [0-9]+.[0-9]+.[0-9]+
        -rc=<CANDIDATE>   : set the release candidate number to <CANDIDATE>

    android_publish_rc        : publish the generated RC to Box
      options:
        -h                : show full help text
        -v=<VERSION>      : update the version to <VERSION> where <VERSION> is in the form [0-9]+.[0-9]+.[0-9]+
        -rc=<CANDIDATE>   : set the release candidate number to <CANDIDATE>
        -box-dir=<BOXDIR> : the directory of your local synced Box account

    android_publish_release   : promote the latest published RC to Full Release
        -h                : show full help text
        -v=<VERSION>      : update the version to <VERSION> where <VERSION> is in the form [0-9]+.[0-9]+.[0-9]+
        -rc=<CANDIDATE>   : set the release candidate number to <CANDIDATE>
        -box-dir=<BOXDIR> : the directory of your local synced Box account

If these scripts don't exist, run 'make all' from the SDK root
directory (the one just above this current 'script' directory).

If you getting a doxygen error, try (re) installing doxygen e.g.
$ brew install doxygen
