Instructions for adding VisualOn HLS playback engine to your Ooyala SDK based app.

1. Obtain visualon-libs.zip package that is distributed separately
2. Unzip the content of the package into <your-app-root>/libs folder, such as it will now contain the following items (in addition to other libraries you may have):

  armeabi/libvo*.so files
  voOSBasePlayer.jar
  voOSDataSource.jar
  voOSEngine.jar
  voOSUtils.jar

3. Obtain visualon-license.zip package that is distributed separately
4. Unzip the content of the package into <your-app-root>/assets folder, such as it will now contain the following items (in addition to other libraries you may have):

  cap.xml
  voVidDec.dat


5. Refresh, clean and re-build your project, you should now see the new items appearing in the libs folder in the project

6. Enable the HLS playback on Android 2+ by setting the following flags:
            OoyalaPlayer.enableHLS = true;
            OoyalaPlayer.enableCustomHLSPlayer = true;

7. Deploy your app to a device for testing. If everything was done correctly, you will now be able to play HLS encoded videos (including Live streaming) on your Android 2+ devices.
